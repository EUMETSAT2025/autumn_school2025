    "This notebook demonstrates how to correct LI LFL or LGR locations for parallax and times for light travel time between cloud tops and the LI instrument. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parallax correction is needed as LI observes lightning optical emission at cloud top height. Depending on the location in the field of view, the season, and the storm type, this can be anywhere between ~6 km to ~20 km of altitude. This, in combination with the viewing angle of the MTG-I1 satellite, results in some offset between the lightning locations in the LI LFL/LGR product and the actual lightning/thunderstorm location on the ground. Generally, LI LFL/LGR locations appear further from the sub-satellite point (0&deg;N and 0&deg;E) than the actual lightning locations. The further from the sub-satellite point, the greater the offset. The offsets in Europe are expected to be up to tens of kilometers (increasing from southwest to northeast) with uncorrected lightning locations being too far north/northeast from actual storms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The light travel time (LTT) correction is required as it takes some time for the photons to reach the LI instrument. The altitude of the geostationary orbit is approximately 36 000 km, resulting in ~120 ms photon travel time between the cloud tops and the LI instrument at the sub-satellite point. Due to Earth's curvature, the LTT increases up to ~140 ms along the edges of the visible disk. The LTT correction doesn't make a big difference in the operational use of the data, but becomes critical if LI groups/flashes are compared with the observations of other lightning location systems.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As the LI L2 products are not corrected for the parallax and LTT effects, all users are provided with tools for introducting the necessary corrections. The tools consist of Montly Cloud top Height (CTH) look-up tables (LUTs) and a set of python functions. The monthly CTH LUTs are derived from SEVIRI 13-year ice-cloud top height climatology (thunderstorm tops are at the ice cloud alatitude). The python functions take the time and location of each LFL/LGR, derive its corresponding parallax and LTT corrections and apply these to the intial uncorrected LFL/LGR locations and times. The resulting corrected lightning locations and times are normally well in line with actual storm locations and the data of ground-based lightning location systems. There are a couple of situations where the parallax correction might not fully remove the initial location offset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Very close to the edges of the LI field-of-view, especially along the edges of the visible Earth disk. The viewing angle of the satellite becomes parallel to the ground there and no meaningful parallax correction can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Untypical storms. An example would be a storm with unusually high or low cloud top height in the particular location and time of the year. Such large deviations from the CTH climatology will result in over- or undercorrection of the parallax effect. The issue has a possible workaround using real-time FCI cloud top height instead of the CTH climatology (this option will be provided later during the mission).   \n",
    "\n",
    "All the examples below use the LFL product, but the code can be easily adjusted to read and correct the locations of LGRs. "
