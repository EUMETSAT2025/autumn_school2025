    "LSA-SAF Land Surface Temperature - All Sky Version 2 product ([MLST-ASv2](https://lsa-saf.eumetsat.int/en/data/products/land-surface-temperature-and-emissivity/)) is an estimate for the temperature of the ground surface produced using data from the MSG satellite. In meteorology, the measurement of air temperature at 2 m height in a [Stevenson screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenson_screen) (an instrument shelter) is traditionally used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Land surface temperature (LST) is related to the air temperature (at 2 m), but the exact relationship is rather complicated. In this notebook, we try to illustrate this relation, rather than precisely investigate it. We decided to use the LSA SAF MLST-ASv2 product instead of the LSA SAF Land Surface Temperature product (MLST) since LSA SAF MLST-ASv2 estimates LST even in cloudy conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Air temperature is measured at a limited number of in-situ meteorological stations. On the contrary, the satellite measurements conducted by the Meteosat Second Generation satellite (MSG) provide gridded data on a full disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area covered by a single pixel typically does not have uniform distribution as the temperature is greatly affected by land cover, altitude, etc. Examples of heterogeneous pixels can be urbanized areas and geographically diverse areas (mountains, hills, different types of vegetation, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the exact relationship between air temperature and satellite based LST would have numerous useful applications. There are several methodologies to find the relationship between air temperature and LST. For example, there is both a seasonal dependency ([Noserikia et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167306)) and a major land cover dependency ([do Nascimento et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos13030491)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we aim to demonstrate the differences between LST from MLST-ASv2, and air temperature measured at 2 m height in Stevenson screen."

All measurements are available as `NetCDF4` as well as `HDF5` files, but only the former will be used here. The LSA SAF products files can be downloaded from the [data server](https://datalsasaf.lsasvcs.ipma.pt/PRODUCTS/) available at https://datalsasaf.lsasvcs.ipma.pt/ with prior registration.\n",
    "Data can be downloaded in various ways [tutorial](https://lsa-saf.eumetsat.int/en/user-support/tutorials/) , for instance manually, using approach published on [lsasaf_data_access GitLab](https://gitlab.com/helpdesk.landsaf/lsasaf_data_access/-/blob/main/examples/webdav/webdav_colab_example.ipynb) repository or using [WebDAV protocol](https://gitlab.com/helpdesk.landsaf/lsasaf_data_access/-/wikis/data/webdav). An additional option is to use the `GNU Wget` program. [wget example](01_MLST_plot_NetCDF4.ipynb#wget)\n",
